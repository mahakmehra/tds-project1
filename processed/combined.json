How did we decide what to evaluate?\n\n\nAll the image ids we evaluated were what \nyou\n submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by \n@s.anand\n as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos \nyou\n gave us.\n\n\nFor clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.\n\n\nHow to fix bugs in our scripts\n\n\nCreate Pull requests to \nJivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1\n .\n\n\nDocker Image Architecture Issue Report\n\n\nIf your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:\n\n\nSubmit Report\n\n\nBug fixes\n\n\nIf you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix.

I\u2019ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?\n\nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?\n\n\nThank you and Regards\n\nAkshit\n\nANSWER: Yes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses.\n\nHowever, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different.\n\nIs this information available to everyone \n@carlton\n sir?",

The \nlive sessions and guidance\n have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\n\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\n\n\nKey Challenges Faced\n\n\n \nLack of Prerequisites\n\n\nThis course did not list any \nprerequisites\n, leading many students\u2014including those from \nnon-technical backgrounds\n\u2014to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the \ncourse content, assignments, and projects\n have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n\n\n \nProject Complexity & Deadline Pressure\n\n\nThe \ndifficulty of the projects\n has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to \nrely heavily on peer support\n just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\n\n\n \nCourse Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\n\n\nMany students joined \nTDS\n based on past \nDiscourse posts and feedback\n, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition\u2014especially for \nworking professionals\n and students without prior experience.\n\n\n \nRemote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\n\n\nWhile we have put in significant effort\u2014spending \n2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)\n to secure good scores\u2014we still find ourselves \nstruggling to meet expectations\n for the \nprojects and RoE\n, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\n\n\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\n\n\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\n\n\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.\n\nANSWER: Yes sir please look into this",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\n\n\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\n\n\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure\u2019s voice emerged from the gloom, \u201cYou are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\u201d\n\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\n\n\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\n\n\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund\u2019s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\n\n\nMiranda\u2019s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor\u2019s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor\u2019s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"\n\nANSWER: i downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg  and used this\n\n\nConvert your MP3 to Text for Free Online\n, it worked",

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\n\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\n\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\n\n\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only\u2026 please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\n\n\n\n\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\n\n\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\n\n\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\n\n\nFor mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\n\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\n\n\nRun evalute.py using uv.\n\n\n\n\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\n\n\nHope that gives clarity.\n\n\nKind regards",

Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.\n\nANSWER: Hi Hari,\n\n\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\n\n\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\n\n\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\n\n\nKind regards",

    "text": "QUESTION: Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\n\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn\u2019t installing directly via pip be more practical?\n\n\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I\u2019d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.\n\nANSWER: Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsolation\n \u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility\n \u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortability\n \u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\n\n\u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\n\n\n\nUsing requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Best for \nreproducibility\n and \ncollaboration\n since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\n\n\u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup.\n\n\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n\n\n\u2022 If you \ndon\u2019t specify a version\n, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n\n\n\u2022 If you \ndo specify a version (package==1.2.3)\n, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\n\n\nHandling Version Conflicts\n\n\n\u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n\n\n\u2022 Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\n\n\u2022 Using \ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\n\n\u2022 Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\n\n\nBest Practices Summary\n\n\n\n\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\n\n\nUse a \nrequirements.txt\n file for reproducibility.\n\n\nPin versions cautiously\u2014avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\n\n\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\n\n\n\nKind regards",

    "text": "Unicode (#/unicode?id=unicode) Unicode Ever noticed when you copy-paste some text and get garbage symbols? Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky. Learn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn\u2019t enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language. Some programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly. Learn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world. Unicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand: Character Encodings : Different ways to represent text in computers ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple Common encoding issues you\u2019ll encounter: # Reading files with explicit encoding with open ( 'file.txt' , encoding = 'utf-8' ) as f : text = f . read ( ) # Handling encoding errors import pandas as pd\ndf = pd . read_csv ( 'data.csv' , encoding = 'utf-8' , errors = 'replace' ) # Detecting file encoding import chardet with open ( 'unknown.txt' , 'rb' ) as f : result = chardet . detect ( f . read ( ) ) print ( result [ 'encoding' ] ) Copy to clipboard Error Copied  (https://youtu.be/jeIBNn5Y5fI) PreviousJavaScript tools: npx (#/npx) Previous JavaScript tools: npx NextBrowser: DevTools (#/devtools) Next Browser: DevTools",

Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time. Here are things you should know when you\u2019re compressing images: Image dimensions are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot Lossless compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data Lossy compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files Vector formats (SVG) scale without quality loss WebP is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless Here\u2019s a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025. Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it\u2019s vector graphics or you can convert it to one) Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP Common operations with Python: from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image import io async def compress_image ( input_path : Path , output_path : Path , quality : int = 85 ) - > None : \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\" with Image . open ( input_path ) as img : # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed if img . mode == 'RGBA' : img = img . convert ( 'RGB' ) # Optimize for web img . save ( output_path , 'WEBP' , quality = quality , optimize = True ) # Batch process images paths = Path ( 'images' ) . glob ( '*.jpg' ) for p in paths : await compress_image ( p , p . with_suffix ( '.webp' ) ) Copy to clipboard Error Copied Command line tools include cwebp (https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp) cwebp , pngquant (https://pngquant.org/) pngquant , jpegoptim (https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim) jpegoptim , and ImageMagick (https://imagemagick.org/) ImageMagick . # Convert to WebP cwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp # Optimize PNG pngquant --quality = 65 -80 image.png # Optimize JPEG jpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max = 85 image.jpg # Convert and resize convert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg # Batch convert mogrify -format webp -quality 85 *.jpg Copy to clipboard Error Copied Watch this video on modern image formats and optimization (15 min):  (https://youtu.be/F1kYBnY6mwg) Tools for image optimization: squoosh.app (https://squoosh.app/) squoosh.app : Browser-based compression ImageOptim (https://imageoptim.com/) ImageOptim : GUI tool for Mac sharp (https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) sharp : Node.js image processing Pillow (https://python-pillow.org/) Pillow : Python imaging library PreviousMarkdown (#/markdown) Previous Markdown NextStatic hosting: GitHub Pages (#/github-pages) Next Static hosting: GitHub Pages",

    "text": "Serverless hosting: Vercel (#/vercel?id=serverless-hosting-vercel) Serverless hosting: Vercel Why Vercel? I evaluated from https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#2-cloud-platforms\n\n- AWS, Azure, Google Cloud are too complex for beginners\n- Cloudflare (next most popular, widely admired) Python support is in beta\n- Hetzner (most admired), Supabase (next most admired) do not have a serverless platform\n- Fly.io (next most admired) does not have a free tier\n- Heroku (used in previous terms) is the least admired\n- Vercel is both popular, admired, growing, has a free plan, and a simple API Serverless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They\u2019re perfect for small web tools that don\u2019t need to run all the time . Here are some common real-life uses: A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day) A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo) A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question) A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up) A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale) You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they\u2019re done, these copies disappear. It\u2019s cheaper than running a full-time server because you\u2019re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time! Rather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example: You can\u2019t pip install packages - you have to use requirements.txt You can\u2019t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs. You can\u2019t run commands (e.g. subprocess.run() ) Vercel (https://vercel.com/) Vercel is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments. Here\u2019s a quickstart (https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python) quickstart . Sign-up with Vercel (https://vercel.com/signup) Sign-up with Vercel . Create an empty git repo with this api/index.py file.

GOOD : Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it\u2019s observed and its significance in astronomy. (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.) When you ask a question, don\u2019t be vague. Spell it out.

For example: To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight\u2026 To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through\u2026 Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.) Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch.

This leads to more logical, well-structured answers. BAD : Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.) GOOD : Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step. (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.) Ask the model to think step by step. Don\u2019t ask the model to just give the final answer right away.\nThat\u2019s like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head.\nInstead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves \u2014 like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb.\nFor example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.

This provides context and helps tailor the response style. BAD : Explain how to fix a software bug. (Reason: No role or perspective given.) GOOD : You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process. (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.) Tell the model who they are. Maybe they\u2019re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication.\nBy clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style.\nSuddenly, your explanation sounds like it\u2019s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.

BAD : Give me the steps in plain text. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.) GOOD : Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points. (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.) BAD : Correct the spelling and show the corrections. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions) GOOD : Correct the spelling, showing <ins>additions</ins> and <del>deletions</del>. (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.) Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand.\nYou can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points.\nThese make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes. Use JSON for machine-readable output (#/prompt-engineering?id=use-json-for-machine-readable-output) Use JSON for machine-readable output When you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized. BAD : Just list the items. (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.) GOOD : Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this: ``` json [ { \"name\" : \"Item 1\" , \"description\" : \"Description of Item 1\" } , { \"name\" : \"Item 2\" , \"description\" : \"Description of Item 2\" } , { \"name\" : \"Item 3\" , \"description\" : \"Description of Item 3\" } ] ``` Copy to clipboard Error Copied (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.) Note: Always use JSON schema (#/playground?id=attachments) JSON schema if possible. JSON schema (https://json-schema.org/) JSON schema is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema. Imagine you\u2019re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile \u2014 it\u2019s hard to find what you need later.\nJSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes.\nEverything has its place: fields like \u2018name,\u2019 \u2018description,\u2019 and \u2018value\u2019 make the data easy to read, especially for machines.\nFor example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object.\nThat way, when you hand it to a program, it\u2019s all clear and ready to use. Prefer Yes/No answers (#/prompt-engineering?id=prefer-yesno-answers) Prefer Yes/No answers Convert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales. BAD : On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works? (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.) GOOD : Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No. (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what\u2019s being asked.) Don\u2019t ask \u2018On a scale of one to five\u2026\u2019. Models are not good with numbers.\nThey don\u2019t know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. \u2018Yes or no?\u2019 is simple. It\u2019s clear. It\u2019s quick.\nSo, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no. Ask for reason first, then the answer (#/prompt-engineering?id=ask-for-reason-first-then-the-answer) Ask for reason first, then the answer Instruct the model to provide its reasoning steps before stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results. BAD : What is the best route to take? (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.) GOOD : First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you\u2019ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route. (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.) BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second.\nThat way, the model won\u2019t be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper. Use proper spelling and grammar (#/prompt-engineering?id=use-proper-spelling-and-grammar) Use proper spelling and grammar A well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model. BAD : xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser?? (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.) GOOD : Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation. (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.) If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly.\nWhen you do, the response will be much clearer.

    "text": "Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models (#/embeddings?id=embeddings-openai-and-local-models) Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models Embedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar. This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems: Search . Find similar documents to a query. Classification . Classify text into categories. Clustering . Group similar items into clusters. Anomaly Detection . Find an unusual piece of text. You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality. Feature Local Models API Privacy High Dependent on provider Cost High setup, low after that Pay-as-you-go Scale Limited by local resources Easily scales with demand Quality Varies by model Typically high The Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) (https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at: Rank . Higher ranked models have higher quality. Memory Usage . Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run. Embedding Dimensions . Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store. Max Tokens . Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a single input. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.

Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you DON\u2019T need a vector database. You can can use numpy for these tasks.) Vector databases are an evolving space. The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called HNSW (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world) HNSW (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor).

Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain\u2011specific questions without fine\u2011tuning. In particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example: Q = \"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" # Answer: fat arrow Q = \"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\" # Answer: node.getChildren() Q = \"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren\u2019t in the AST called?\" # Answer: trivia Q = \"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\" # Answer: !!

    "text": "Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (Hybrid RAG) with TypeSense (#/hybrid-rag-typesense?id=hybrid-retrieval-augmented-generation-hybrid-rag-with-typesense) Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (Hybrid RAG) with TypeSense Hybrid RAG combines semantic (vector) search with traditional keyword search to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance. By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. TypeSense (https://typesense.org/) TypeSense makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation. Below is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line. Install and run TypeSense (#/hybrid-rag-typesense?id=install-and-run-typesense) Install and run TypeSense Install TypeSense (https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html) Install TypeSense . mkdir typesense-data docker run -p 8108 :8108 \\ -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \\ --data-dir /data \\ --api-key = secret-key \\ --enable-cors Copy to clipboard Error Copied docker run : spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108 -p 8108:8108 maps host port to container port. -v typesense-data:/data mounts a Docker volume for persistence. --data-dir /data points TypeSense at that volume. --api-key=secret-key secures your API. --enable-cors allows browser-based requests. Expected output: Docker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as Started Typesense API server . Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8108 . Embed and import documents into TypeSense (#/hybrid-rag-typesense?id=embed-and-import-documents-into-typesense) Embed and import documents into TypeSense Follow the steps in the RAG with the CLI (#/rag-cli) RAG with the CLI tutorial to create a chunks.json that has one {id, content} JSON object per line. TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents (https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#option-b-auto-embedding-generation-within-typesense) TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents . We\u2019ll use that capability.

Web crawling is essential in many data-driven scenarios: Data mining and analysis : Gathering structured data from multiple pages for market research, competitive analysis, or academic research Content archiving : Creating offline copies of websites for preservation or backup purposes SEO analysis : Analyzing site structure, metadata, and content to improve search rankings Legal compliance : Capturing website content for regulatory or compliance documentation Website migration : Creating a complete copy before moving to a new platform or design Offline access : Downloading educational resources, documentation, or reference materials for use without internet connection The most commonly used tool for fetching websites is wget (https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) wget . It is pre-installed in many UNIX distributions and easy to install.  (https://youtu.be/pLfH5TZBGXo) To crawl the IIT Madras Data Science Program website (https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/) IIT Madras Data Science Program website for example, you could run: wget \\ --recursive \\ --level = 3 \\ --no-parent \\ --convert-links \\ --adjust-extension \\ --compression = auto \\ --accept html,htm \\ --directory-prefix = ./ds \\ https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ Copy to clipboard Error Copied Here\u2019s what each option does: --recursive : Enables recursive downloading (following links) --level=3 : Limits recursion depth to 3 levels from the initial URL --no-parent : Restricts crawling to only URLs below the initial directory --convert-links : Converts all links in downloaded documents to work locally --adjust-extension : Adds proper extensions to files (.html, .jpg, etc.) based on MIME types --compression=auto : Automatically handles compressed content (gzip, deflate) --accept html,htm : Only downloads files with these extensions --directory-prefix=./ds : Saves all downloaded files to the specified directory wget2 (https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2) wget2 is a better version of wget and supports HTTP2, parallel connections, and only updates modified sites. The syntax is (mostly) the same. wget2 \\ --recursive \\ --level = 3 \\ --no-parent \\ --convert-links \\ --adjust-extension \\ --compression = auto \\ --accept html,htm \\ --directory-prefix = ./ds \\ https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ Copy to clipboard Error Copied There are popular free and open-source alternatives to Wget: Wpull (#/crawling-cli?id=wpull) Wpull Wpull (https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/wpull) Wpull is a wget\u2010compatible Python crawler that supports on-disk resumption, WARC output, and PhantomJS integration. uvx wpull \\ --recursive \\ --level = 3 \\ --no-parent \\ --convert-links \\ --adjust-extension \\ --compression = auto \\ --accept html,htm \\ --directory-prefix = ./ds \\ https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ Copy to clipboard Error Copied HTTrack (#/crawling-cli?id=httrack) HTTrack HTTrack (https://www.httrack.com/html/fcguide.html) HTTrack is dedicated website\u2010mirroring tool with rich filtering and link\u2010conversion options. httrack \"https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\" \\ -O \"./ds\" \\ \"+*.study.iitm.ac.in/ds/*\" \\ -r3 Copy to clipboard Error Copied Robots.txt (#/crawling-cli?id=robotstxt) Robots.txt robots.txt is a standard file found in a website\u2019s root directory that specifies which parts of the site should not be accessed by web crawlers. It\u2019s part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol, an ethical standard for web crawling. Why it\u2019s important : Server load protection : Prevents excessive traffic that could overload servers Privacy protection : Keeps sensitive or private content from being indexed Legal compliance : Respects website owners\u2019 rights to control access to their content Ethical web citizenship : Shows respect for website administrators\u2019 wishes How to override robots.txt restrictions : wget, wget2 : Use -e robots=off httrack : Use -s0 wpull : Use --no-robots When to override robots.txt (use with discretion) : Only bypass robots.txt when: You have explicit permission from the website owner You\u2019re crawling your own website The content is publicly accessible and your crawling won\u2019t cause server issues You\u2019re conducting authorized security testing Remember that bypassing robots.txt without legitimate reason may: Violate terms of service Lead to IP banning Result in legal consequences in some jurisdictions Cause reputation damage to your organization Always use the minimum necessary crawling speed and scope, and consider contacting website administrators for permission when in doubt.

    "text": "Converting PDFs to Markdown (#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=converting-pdfs-to-markdown) Converting PDFs to Markdown PDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs). Use Cases: LLM training and fine-tuning : Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training Knowledge base creation : Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents Content repurposing : Convert academic papers and reports for web publication Data extraction : Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis Accessibility : Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers Citation and reference management : Extract bibliographic information from academic papers Documentation conversion : Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation PyMuPDF4LLM (#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=pymupdf4llm) PyMuPDF4LLM PyMuPDF4LLM (https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm/) PyMuPDF4LLM is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It\u2019s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities. PyMuPDF4LLM uses MuPDF (https://mupdf.com/) MuPDF as its PDF parsing engine. PyMuPDF (https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) PyMuPDF is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures. PYTHONUTF8 = 1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))' Copy to clipboard Error Copied PYTHONUTF8=1 : Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale uv run --with pymupdf4llm : Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package python -c '...' : Executes Python code directly from the command line import pymupdf4llm : Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\") : Creates a file to write the markdown output h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\")) : Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file Markitdown (#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=markitdown) Markitdown  (https://youtu.be/v65Oyddfxeg) Markitdown (https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) Markitdown is Microsoft\u2019s tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It\u2019s a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents. PYTHONUTF8 = 1 uvx markitdown $FILE .pdf > markitdown.md Copy to clipboard Error Copied PYTHONUTF8=1 : Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding uvx markitdown : Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager $FILE.pdf : The input PDF file > markitdown.md : Redirects output to a markdown file Unstructured (#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=unstructured) Unstructured Unstructured (https://unstructured.io/) Unstructured is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained. GROBID (#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=grobid) GROBID If you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR\u2019ed ones, GROBID (https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) GROBID remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy. # Start GROBID service docker run -t --rm -p 8070 :8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2 # Process PDF with curl curl -X POST -F \"input=@paper.pdf\" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references.tei.xml Copy to clipboard Error Copied Mistral OCR API (#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=mistral-ocr-api) Mistral OCR API Mistral OCR (https://mistral.ai/products/ocr/) Mistral OCR offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing. Azure Document Intelligence API (#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=azure-document-intelligence-api) Azure Document Intelligence API For enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, Azure Document Intelligence (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/document-intelligence) Azure Document Intelligence provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID\u2019s reference extraction capabilities. Other libraries (#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=other-libraries) Other libraries Docling (https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) Docling is IBM\u2019s document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction. MegaParse (https://github.com/QuivrHQ/MegaParse) MegaParse takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.

    "text": "Converting HTML to Markdown (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=converting-html-to-markdown) Converting HTML to Markdown When working with web content, converting HTML files to plain text or Markdown is a common requirement for content extraction, analysis, and preservation. For example: Content analysis : Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing Data mining : Strip formatting to focus on the actual content Offline reading : Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption Content migration : Move content between different CMS platforms SEO analysis : Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization Archive creation : Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats Accessibility : Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers This tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow \u2013 all using the command line. defuddle-cli (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=defuddle-cli) defuddle-cli defuddle-cli (https://github.com/defuddle/defuddle) defuddle-cli specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It\u2019s a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important. find . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse { } --md -o { } .md \\ ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied find . -name '*.html' : Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories -exec ... \\; : Executes the following command for each file found npx --package defuddle-cli -y : Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting defuddle parse {} --md : Parses the HTML file (represented by {} ) and converts to markdown -o {}.md : Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension Pandoc (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=pandoc) Pandoc Pandoc (https://pandoc.org/) Pandoc is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters. Pandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors.  (https://youtu.be/HPSK7q13-40) find . -name '*.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o { } .md { } \\ ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied find . -name '*.html' : Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories -exec ... \\; : Executes the following command for each file found pandoc : The Swiss Army knife of document conversion -f html -t markdown_strict : Convert from HTML format to strict markdown -o {}.md {} : Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument Lynx (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=lynx) Lynx Lynx (https://lynx.invisible-island.net/) Lynx is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files. find . -type f -name '*.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' _ { } + Copy to clipboard Error Copied find . -type f -name '*.html' : Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories -exec sh -c '...' _ {} + : Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency for f; do ... done : Loops through each file in the batch lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" : Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text -dump : Output the rendered page to stdout -nolist : Don\u2019t include the list of links at the end > \"${f%.html}.txt\" : Save output to a .txt file with the same base name w3m (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=w3m) w3m w3m (https://w3m.sourceforge.net/) w3m is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial. find . -type f -name '*.html' \\ -exec sh -c 'for f; do \\\n      w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.md\"; \\\n    done' _ { } + Copy to clipboard Error Copied find . -type f -name '*.html' : Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories -exec sh -c '...' _ {} + : Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency for f; do ... done : Loops through each file in the batch w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" : Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML -dump : Output the rendered page to stdout -T text/html : Specify input format as HTML -cols 80 : Set output width to 80 columns -no-graph : Don\u2019t show graphic characters for tables and frames > \"${f%.html}.md\" : Save output to a .md file with the same base name Comparison (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=comparison) Comparison Approach Speed Format Quality Preservation Best For defuddle-cli Slow High Good structure and links Content migration, publishing pandoc Slow Very High Almost everything Academic papers, documentation lynx Fast Low Basic structure only Quick extraction, large batches w3m Very Slow Medium-Low Basic structure with better tables Improved readability over lynx Optimize Batch Processing (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=optimize-batch-processing) Optimize Batch Processing Process in parallel : Use GNU Parallel for multi-core processing: find . -name \"*.html\" | parallel \"pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {}\" Copy to clipboard Error Copied Filter files before processing : find . -name \"*.html\" -type f -size -1M -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown { } -o { } .md \\ ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Customize output format with additional parameters: # For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting find . -name \"*.html\" -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown --wrap = preserve --atx-headers { } -o { } .md \\ ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Handle errors gracefully : find . -name \"*.html\" -exec sh -c 'for f; do pandoc -f html -t markdown \"$f\" -o \"${f%.html}.md\" 2>/dev/null || echo \"Failed: $f\" >> conversion_errors.log; done' _ { } + Copy to clipboard Error Copied Choosing the Right Tool (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=choosing-the-right-tool) Choosing the Right Tool Need speed with minimal formatting? Use the lynx approach Need precise, complete conversion? Use pandoc Need a balance of structure and cleanliness? Try defuddle-cli Working with complex tables? w3m might render them better Remember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text. Combined Crawling and Conversion (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=combined-crawling-and-conversion) Combined Crawling and Conversion Sometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like Crawl4AI (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=crawl4ai) Crawl4AI or markdown-crawler (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=markdown-crawler) markdown-crawler . For research/data collection : Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion For simple website archiving : Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution For high-quality conversion : Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion For maximum speed : Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline Crawl4AI (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=crawl4ai) Crawl4AI Crawl4AI (https://github.com/crawl4ai/crawl4ai) Crawl4AI is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text. uv venv source .venv/bin/activate.fish\nuv pip install crawl4ai\ncrawl4ai-setup Copy to clipboard Error Copied uv venv : Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv) source .venv/bin/activate.fish : Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax) uv pip install crawl4ai : Installs the crawl4ai package crawl4ai-setup : Initializes crawl4ai\u2019s required dependencies markdown-crawler (#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=markdown-crawler) markdown-crawler markdown-crawler (https://pypi.org/project/markdown-crawler/) markdown-crawler combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It\u2019s efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lower-quality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle. Best for projects where quantity and integration are more important than perfect formatting. uv venv source .venv/bin/activate.fish\nuv pip install markdown-crawler\nmarkdown-crawler -t 5 -d 3 -b ./markdown https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ Copy to clipboard Error Copied uv venv and activation: Same as above uv pip install markdown-crawler : Installs the markdown-crawler package markdown-crawler : Runs the crawler with these options: -t 5 : Sets 5 threads for parallel crawling -d 3 : Limits crawl depth to 3 levels -b ./markdown : Sets the base output directory Final argument is the starting URL PreviousConvert PDFs to Markdown (#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown) Previous Convert PDFs to Markdown NextLLM Website Scraping (#/llm-website-scraping) Next LLM Website Scraping",

(powers of 1000).\nBinary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.\n\nThe TIME_STYLE argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT.\nFORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FORMAT1 < newline > FORMAT2,\nthen FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.\nTIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.\nAlso the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default style to use.\n\nUsing color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and\nwith --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when\nstandard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment\nvariable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.\n\nExit status:\n 0  if OK,\n 1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),\n 2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).\n\nGNU coreutils online help: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>\nFull documentation <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/ls>\nor available locally via: info '(coreutils) ls invocation' Copy to clipboard Error Copied # By default, it just lists all file names !ls Copy to clipboard Error Copied sample_data  s-anand.net-Apr-2024.gz Copy to clipboard Error Copied # If we want to see the size of the file, use `-l` for the long-listing format !ls - l Copy to clipboard Error Copied total 5672\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Jun  6 14:21 sample_data\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5801198 Jun  9 05:18 s-anand.net-Apr-2024.gz Copy to clipboard Error Copied Uncompress the log file (#/data-preparation-in-the-shell?id=uncompress-the-log-file) Uncompress the log file gzip is the most popular compression format on the web.

The main problem is the date. Instead of [31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500] it should have been \"31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500\" We\u2019ll use sed (stream editor) to replace the characters. sed is like grep but lets you replace, not just search. (Actually, sed can do a lot more. It\u2019s a full-fledged editor. You can insert, delete, edit, etc. programmatically. In fact, sed has truly remarkable features that this paragraph is too small to contain.) The regular expression we will use is \\[\\([^]]*\\)\\] . The way this works is: \\[ : Match the opening square bracket. \\([^]]*\\) : Capture everything inside the square brackets (non-greedy match for any character except ] ). \\] : Match the closing square bracket. BTW, I didn\u2019t create this. ChatGPT did (https://chatgpt.com/share/7f14e9d2-15ec-4562-b263-61547d2230f3) ChatGPT did . sed \"s/abc/xyz/\" FILE replaces abc with xyz in the file.

But when I did that, I faced another problem. Some of the lines had extra columns. That\u2019s because the \u201cUser Agent\u201d values sometimes contain a quote. CSV files are supposed to escape quotes with \"\" \u2013 two double quotes. But Apache uses \\\" instead. I\u2019ll leave it as an exercise for you to fix that.

Below are common cleaning tasks using the DuckDB CLI. Create a Sample Dataset (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=create-a-sample-dataset) Create a Sample Dataset Let\u2019s create a sample dataset that mimics real business data patterns - incomplete customer records, time-series orders, and regional variations. Before working with messy production data, you need a controlled environment to test data cleaning techniques. This sample represents common e-commerce scenarios: missing customer info (20% of orders), seasonal patterns (15-day cycles), and geographic segmentation that drive business decisions like inventory placement and marketing campaigns. duckdb sample.duckdb << 'SQL'\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders AS\nSELECT\n  seq AS order_id,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 5 = 0 THEN NULL ELSE 'Customer ' || seq END AS customer,\n  date '2025-01-01' + CAST(seq % 15 AS INTEGER) AS order_date,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 3 = 0 THEN 'Widget ' || seq ELSE 'Gadget ' || seq END AS product,\n  round(random()*1000, 2) AS amount,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 4 = 0 THEN 'EU' ELSE 'US' END AS region\nFROM range(1, 50) tbl(seq);\nSQL Copy to clipboard Error Copied Create a Messy CSV (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=create-a-messy-csv) Create a Messy CSV Let\u2019s also simulate real-world data export issues - unescaped quotes, missing delimiters, and malformed records that break standard CSV parsers. Data rarely arrives clean. Export systems fail, manual data entry introduces errors, and third-party integrations send malformed files. Learning to handle corrupted CSV files prevents hours of debugging and ensures your data pipeline doesn\u2019t break when inevitably receiving bad data from vendors, APIs, or legacy systems. cat << 'EOF' > messy_orders.csv order_id,customer,order_date,product,amount,region\n1,Customer 1,2025-01-01,Widget 1,100,US\n\"2,Customer 2,2025-01-02,Gadget 2,200,US\n3,Customer 3,2025-01-03,Gadget 3,300,EU\nEOF Copy to clipboard Error Copied Create a Big CSV (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=create-a-big-csv) Create a Big CSV Next, we\u2019ll create a large dataset to practice memory-efficient processing techniques that handle files too big to fit in RAM. When working with millions of customer records, transaction logs, or sensor data, traditional tools crash or run out of memory. DuckDB\u2019s streaming capabilities let you process 100GB+ files on laptops by reading data in chunks, making big data analysis accessible without expensive infrastructure. duckdb sample.duckdb << 'SQL'\nCOPY (SELECT seq AS id, random() AS val FROM range(100000)) TO 'big.csv';\nSQL Copy to clipboard Error Copied Exploratory Data Analysis (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=exploratory-data-analysis) Exploratory Data Analysis We need to examine our data structure and quality before making business decisions. Every data analysis starts with understanding what you have - missing values can skew customer segmentation, outliers affect revenue forecasting, and data types determine which analytical techniques work. Quick EDA prevents costly mistakes like launching marketing campaigns based on incomplete customer data or setting prices using corrupted transaction amounts. -- Preview and get stats SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 5 ; DESCRIBE orders ; SELECT COUNT ( * ) AS n , AVG ( amount ) AS avg_amount FROM orders ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Converting Data to Other Formats (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=converting-data-to-other-formats) Converting Data to Other Formats Let\u2019s export cleaned data to formats optimized for different business needs. Analytics teams need Parquet for fast querying, APIs require JSON for web integration, and executives want CSV for Excel compatibility. Format conversion ensures your cleaned data reaches every stakeholder in their preferred format, enabling faster decision-making across departments without forcing everyone to learn SQL. COPY ( SELECT * FROM orders ) TO 'orders.json' ( FORMAT JSON ) ; COPY ( SELECT * FROM orders ) TO 'orders.parquet' ( FORMAT PARQUET ) ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Reading Messy CSV (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=reading-messy-csv) Reading Messy CSV We need to handle corrupted files that would normally crash your data pipeline. Real-world CSV files from vendors, legacy systems, or manual exports often contain malformed rows that break standard parsers. Instead of spending hours manually fixing files or losing critical business data, DuckDB\u2019s error handling lets you salvage usable records while identifying problem areas for follow-up with data providers. -- Skip bad lines while loading SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto ( 'messy_orders.csv' , ignore_errors = true ) ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Handling Missing Values (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=handling-missing-values) Handling Missing Values It\u2019s important to address incomplete data that could lead to wrong business conclusions. Missing customer names prevent personalized marketing, absent transaction amounts skew revenue calculations, and incomplete addresses block shipping. Rather than excluding entire records and losing valuable information, strategic imputation preserves data for analysis while clearly marking assumptions made during the cleaning process. -- Replace null customer names SELECT COALESCE ( customer , 'Unknown' ) AS customer FROM orders ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied String Operations (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=string-operations) String Operations It\u2019s common to standardize text data that comes from multiple sources with inconsistent formatting. Product names from different suppliers use varying cases, customer entries have extra spaces, and imported data contains mixed formatting. Clean, consistent strings enable accurate grouping for inventory management, prevent duplicate customer records, and ensure search functionality works properly across your application. SELECT DISTINCT TRIM ( LOWER ( product ) ) AS clean_product FROM orders ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Date Parsing and Conversion (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=date-parsing-and-conversion) Date Parsing and Conversion Typically, we transform dates into different formats that enable time-based business analysis. Raw date strings from different systems use various formats that prevent proper sorting and filtering. Converting to standard formats enables monthly sales reporting, seasonal trend analysis, and time-based customer segmentation - critical for inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and financial forecasting. SELECT order_id , STRFTIME ( order_date , '%Y-%m' ) AS order_month FROM orders ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Conditional Logic and Binning (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=conditional-logic-and-binning) Conditional Logic and Binning A common task is to categorize continuous data into meaningful business segments that drive decision-making. Converting exact dollar amounts into price tiers enables targeted marketing (premium vs budget customers), inventory classification (high/medium/low value items), and commission structures. This segmentation forms the foundation for personalized pricing, customer targeting, and performance analysis. SELECT order_id , CASE WHEN amount > 700 THEN 'high' WHEN amount > 300 THEN 'medium' ELSE 'low' END AS price_band FROM orders ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Regex Search and Replace (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=regex-search-and-replace) Regex Search and Replace We often need to clean complex text patterns that simple string operations can\u2019t handle. Product descriptions contain multiple spaces, phone numbers have inconsistent formatting, and addresses mix abbreviations with full words. Regular expressions fix these patterns systematically, ensuring consistent data quality for customer communications, shipping integrations, and search functionality. SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE ( product , '\\\\s+' , ' ' , 'g' ) AS tidy_product FROM orders ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Working with Multiple Formats (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=working-with-multiple-formats) Working with Multiple Formats Let\u2019s combine data from different sources that use various file formats. Modern businesses receive data as CSV exports, JSON from APIs, and Parquet from data warehouses. Rather than maintaining separate processing pipelines, DuckDB\u2019s format flexibility lets you join orders from your CSV exports with customer data from JSON APIs and inventory levels from Parquet files in a single query. CREATE TABLE json_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_json_auto ( 'orders.json' ) ; CREATE TABLE parquet_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet ( 'orders.parquet' ) ; SELECT * FROM orders UNION ALL SELECT * FROM parquet_orders ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Processing in Chunks (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=processing-in-chunks) Processing in Chunks We handle massive datasets that exceed available memory by processing them in manageable segments. When analyzing years of transaction logs, customer behavior data, or sensor readings, loading everything at once crashes systems. Chunk processing enables analysis of terabyte-scale datasets on standard hardware, making enterprise-level data analysis accessible for fraud detection, customer lifetime value calculations, and operational analytics. SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto ( 'big.csv' ) LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 0 ; SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto ( 'big.csv' ) LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 1000 ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Filtering Rows and Dropping Columns (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=filtering-rows-and-dropping-columns) Filtering Rows and Dropping Columns We\u2019ll focus analysis on relevant data subsets while removing sensitive or unnecessary information. Business analysis rarely needs all data - marketing teams want current customers, finance needs profitable regions, and product managers focus on active items. Efficient filtering reduces processing time, protects sensitive data (removing PII columns), and ensures analysis focuses on business-relevant subsets rather than getting lost in comprehensive but unfocused datasets. SELECT order_id , amount FROM orders WHERE region = 'US' ; SELECT * EXCLUDE region FROM orders ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Derived Columns (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=derived-columns) Derived Columns Now, let\u2019s create new business metrics from existing data that drive key performance indicators. Raw transaction amounts become profit margins with tax calculations, customer regions enable territory-based analysis, and dates support seasonal comparisons. These derived metrics power executive dashboards, sales team performance tracking, and automated business rules without requiring manual calculations or separate reporting tools. SELECT * , amount * 0.1 AS tax , UPPER ( region ) AS region_code FROM orders ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Summaries and Pivots (#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=summaries-and-pivots) Summaries and Pivots A big part of data preparation is to transform detailed transaction data into executive-level insights that inform strategic decisions. Converting thousands of individual orders into regional sales summaries, customer segment performance, and product category trends enables quick identification of growth opportunities, underperforming markets, and inventory optimization needs. These aggregations become the foundation for board presentations, budget planning, and strategic initiatives. -- Aggregation SELECT region , COUNT ( * ) AS n_orders , SUM ( amount ) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY region ; -- Pivot by region SELECT * FROM orders PIVOT ( COUNT ( * ) FOR region IN ( 'US' , 'EU' ) ) ; Copy to clipboard Error Copied Useful links: DuckDB Documentation (https://duckdb.org/docs/) DuckDB Documentation SQL Functions (https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/overview) SQL Functions DuckDB Extensions (https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/overview) DuckDB Extensions PreviousData Preparation in the Editor (#/data-preparation-in-the-editor) Previous Data Preparation in the Editor NextCleaning Data with OpenRefine (#/cleaning-data-with-openrefine) Next Cleaning Data with OpenRefine",

    "text": "Parsing JSON (#/parsing-json?id=parsing-json) Parsing JSON JSON is everywhere\u2014APIs, logs, configuration files\u2014and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we\u2019ll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently. For example, we\u2019ll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.  (https://youtu.be/1lxrb_ezP-g) This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don\u2019t fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing: Tool Extract from JSON\u2026 Why jq (#/parsing-json?id=command-line-json-processing-with-jq) jq JSON in the shell Quick data exploration and pipeline processing JMESPath (#/parsing-json?id=jmespath-queries) JMESPath JSON in Python Handle complex queries with a clean syntax ijson (#/parsing-json?id=streaming-with-ijson) ijson JSON streams in Python Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently Pandas (#/parsing-json?id=pandas-json-columns) Pandas JSON columns in Python Fast analysis of structured data SQL JSON (#/parsing-json?id=sql-json-functions) SQL JSON JSON in databases Combine structured and semi-structured data DuckDB (#/parsing-json?id=duckdb-json-processing) DuckDB JSON anywhere Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory Examples: Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis. Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium. Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal. Practice with these resources: JSONPath Online Evaluator (https://jsonpath.com/) JSONPath Online Evaluator : Test JSON queries jq play (https://jqplay.org/) jq play : Interactive jq query testing DuckDB JSON Tutorial (https://duckdb.org/docs/data/json) DuckDB JSON Tutorial : Learn DuckDB JSON functions Command-line JSON Processing with jq (#/parsing-json?id=command-line-json-processing-with-jq) Command-line JSON Processing with jq jq (https://jqlang.org/) jq is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines. Example: Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process. # Extract specific fields from JSONL cat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}' # Transform JSON structure cat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}' # Filter and aggregate cat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})' Copy to clipboard Error Copied JMESPath Queries (#/parsing-json?id=jmespath-queries) JMESPath Queries JMESPath (https://jmespath.org/) JMESPath offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It\u2019s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions. Example: Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service. import jmespath # Example queries data = { \"locations\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Seattle\" , \"state\" : \"WA\" , \"info\" : { \"population\" : 737015 } } , { \"name\" : \"Portland\" , \"state\" : \"OR\" , \"info\" : { \"population\" : 652503 } } ] } # Find all cities with population > 700000 cities = jmespath . search ( \"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\" , data ) Copy to clipboard Error Copied Streaming with ijson (#/parsing-json?id=streaming-with-ijson) Streaming with ijson Loading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. ijson (https://ijson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ijson lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data. Example: Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly. import ijson async def process_large_json ( filepath : str ) - > list : \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\" results = [ ] with open ( filepath , 'rb' ) as file : # Stream objects under the 'items' key parser = ijson . items ( file , 'items.item' ) async for item in parser : if item [ 'value' ] > 100 : # Process conditionally results . append ( item ) return results Copy to clipboard Error Copied Pandas JSON Columns (#/parsing-json?id=pandas-json-columns) Pandas JSON Columns Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/) Pandas makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations. Example: Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns. import pandas as pd # Parse JSON strings in a column df = pd . DataFrame ( { 'json_col' : [ '{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}' , '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}' ] } ) df [ 'parsed' ] = df [ 'json_col' ] . apply ( pd . json_normalize ) # Normalize nested JSON columns df = pd . read_csv ( 'data.csv' ) df_normalized = pd . json_normalize ( df [ 'nested_json' ] . apply ( json . loads ) , record_path = [ 'items' ] , # List of nested objects to unpack meta = [ 'id' , 'timestamp' ] # Keep these columns from parent ) Copy to clipboard Error Copied SQL JSON Functions (#/parsing-json?id=sql-json-functions) SQL JSON Functions SQL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016) SQL supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases.\nThese are implemented by most popular databases, including SQLite (https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html) SQLite , PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html) PostgreSQL , and MySQL (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/json-function-reference.html) MySQL .\nThis is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns. Example: An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries. SELECT json_extract ( data , '$.name' ) as name , json_extract ( data , '$.details.age' ) as age FROM users WHERE json_extract ( data , '$.active' ) = true Copy to clipboard Error Copied DuckDB JSON Processing (#/parsing-json?id=duckdb-json-processing) DuckDB JSON Processing DuckDB (https://duckdb.org/) DuckDB shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data. Example: Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics. SELECT json_extract_string ( data , '$.user.name' ) as name , avg ( json_extract_float ( data , '$.metrics.value' ) ) as avg_value FROM read_json_auto ( 'data/*.jsonl' ) GROUP BY 1 HAVING avg_value > 100 Copy to clipboard Error Copied PreviousCleaning Data with OpenRefine (#/cleaning-data-with-openrefine) Previous Cleaning Data with OpenRefine NextData Transformation with dbt (#/dbt) Next Data Transformation with dbt",

Gemini transcription (#/extracting-audio-and-transcripts?id=gemini-transcription) Gemini transcription The Gemini (https://gemini.google.com/) Gemini models from Google are notable in two ways: They have a huge input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example. They can handle audio input. This allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. LLMs are not good at transcribing audio faithfully . They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples: Transcribe into other languages . Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step. Summarize audio transcripts . For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions. Legal Proceeding Analysis . Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate. Medical Consultation Summary . Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation. Here\u2019s how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. Get a Gemini API key (https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) Gemini API key from Google AI Studio. Set the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable to the API key.
